    History of Mr.Children
    <em>1987-1997</em>
    </h3>
<p>
    <center>Mr.Children is one of the most popular bands in Japan. They made their major debut in 1992 with the release of their first album, "EVERYTHING", but it was not until one of their singles was used as a drama theme song, like their fourth single "Cross Road", that they started getting noticed. They got their big break in 1994 with the release of their fifth single, "innocent world", which made record sales and earned the Japan Record Award in 1994. Their fourth album, "Atomic Heart", which was released in the same year, is still their top selling album. Since then, all their singles have been number one hits in the Oricon charts, like "Tomorrow never knows" and "Namonaki-uta", and many of them became million sellers.</center></p>
<p>
    <center>They started their collaboration work with Kobayashi at his home. Kobayashi was truthful with Sakurai's compositions and lyrics, letting him know when they were and weren't good. In 1992, Mr.Children's debut album, "EVERYTHING", represented the long hard work they put into the album. By the time their third album rolled around, they wanted to create a new vibe so they moved to Waterfront Studio's in New York. After the release of versus, Mr.Children was chosen as the next big thing in various music magazines. It was also around this time that Sakurai made a goal to have a one million seller single. That single was "CROSS ROAD" and was used as a the Japanese TV drama "Dousoukai" theme song. It was during the 22nd week after the release of CROSS ROAD that it finally hit a million copies sold.</center>
</p>
<p>
    <center>When "innocent world", was finally released, Sakurai decided to finally get personal and really sing about what he was feeling. Soon after "Atomic Heart" was released. It was an album that was mixed with both instruments and digital sounds, becoming known as "DigiRock" (Digital Rock). Mr. Children also became involved in charity work, doing a collaboration song with Keisuke Kuwata of Southern All Stars. The song "Kiseki no Hoshi" was used as the campaign song for the Act Against AIDS concerts. [es] Mr.Children in FILM, a documentary, was next and the group went overseas to film it. After the main song "[es] Theme Of Es" was written, the movie opened in theatres. During the release "Namonaki Uta" another change was arriving. The band felt that they had become a machine. According to Suzuki, "I felt like I was carrying a burden somewhere." Interest from the media also grew and a greater interest in Sakurai's private life started because he had succeeded at such a young age (in his 20s at the time) When work began on the next album, the intial idea was to recording in United States, Europe, and Jamaica. The plans were later changed to Tokyo, New York, and London due to unknown reasons. Thus "Shinkai" was recorded and went on to sale over 2.5 million copies. Soon after the "regress or progress" tour began were for the first time they played all the songs on Shinkai. They held 55 conerts and broke records.</center>
